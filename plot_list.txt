| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bar chart       | Standard categorical comparison; thin lines, minimal fill.                                            |
| Barcode plot  x | Alternative to the quartile plot; shows observations with thin lines, semitransparent lines.          |
| Density plot    | For probability density functions; line with lightly filled area; avoid heavy fill.                   |
| Galaxy plot     | 2D heat map; X,Y points with grayscale intensity encoding value; darker = higher.                     |
| Histogram       | Standard; minimal axes, thin outlines, no 3D effects.                                                 |
| Line plot       | Standard; axes only cover domain and range.                                                           |
| Quartile plot   | Replaces box plot for larger sample sizes; median, quartiles, range.                                  |
| Rug plot      x | Scatterplot with barcode plot for marginal distributions, instead of equispaced ticks.                |
| Scatter plot  x | Standard XY plot; good for relationships and correlations.                                            |
| Slope plot      | Shows change in nominal data between two points in time; thin lines preferred.                        |
| Sparkline       | Minimal time series for large sample sizes; thin line, dots optional.                                 |
| Stem-and-leaf   | Like a histogram but shows actual data values; good for small/medium datasets.                        |
| Time series   x | Scatter + connecting lines for low sample sizes; dots optional for clarity.                           |
